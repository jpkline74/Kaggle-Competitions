# Python-Machine-Learning
This has my Kaggle/DataHack submissions, plus some of the projects that I have worked on while learning about python and machine learning. 

BM2 is the BigMart DataHack competition I worked on. This was one of my most recent projects. 
Houseing Prices Work, and Titanic Kaggle Comp are the other competitions I worked on. 
The rest are projects that I worked on while learning how to to use a variety of tools to visualize and manipulate data.
